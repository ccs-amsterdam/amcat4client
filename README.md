# NextJS client for Amcat4

## Run development version

First install stuff. Make sure you have a relatively recent version of node.

```
npm i
```

Make sure to create an .env.local file to set the AmCAT host, e.g.
by copying .env.local.example

```
cp dotenv.local.example .env.local
```

Run locally for development.

```
npm run dev
```
