# Amcat 4 client

NextJS client for Amcat4

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Next doesn't check typescript in dev mode, so remember to build every now and then to see if you're still cool with the TS gods.

```
npm run build
```
